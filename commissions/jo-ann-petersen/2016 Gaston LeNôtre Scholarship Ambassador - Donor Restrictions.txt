Please find attached my completed form for the LeNotre silent auction. The other one you sent was a Microsoft Word version of the same donor form rather than the one for the 2016 Covenant House Auction.

Some clarifications for the donations:

1) The winner of this silent auction item will be entitled to a custom Lego sculpture with maximum dimensions of 11" x 11" x 11" (inches).
2) The Winnie the Pooh Lego sculpture is a representation of what can be built using the $500.00 gift certificate.
3) I would like 3-4 weeks to be able to complete the sculpture after the winner and I have communicated about the details of the piece.
4) Unique detail requests, changes in or hard-to-find (i.e. rare) Lego pieces or changing the piece altogether will cause delays in the completion and delivery of the piece.
5) I will deliver (before the silent auction) and pick up (after the silent auction) the Winnie the Pooh Lego sculpture from the LeNotre office.
6) Interested parties may visit my site at http://bricksinasnap.com to view a small gallery of pieces I have completed. Requests for commissions are not limited to the images in the gallery -- a person's imagination is the only limit to what can be created.
7) Some ideas for pieces might include: birthday party build-your-own Lego creations, table centerpieces, seating reservation holders, a small piece next to a bride or groom's wedding cake, company logo's, product launches, etc.
